<h3>Hey, I am Yugaant! I am a 3rd year student at University of British Columbia specializing in accounting and business technology management.</h3>
<p>I moved to Canada in 2016 for my post secondary studies. Since then, I have been an active member of WalterGage Toastmasters , a world renowned communication and leadership club. Alongside, I was the Secretary and Co-Treasurer for the club as well. In addition to this, I have been involved in various volunteering activities at UBC Farm, UBC Tacs, UBC Jumpstart and Imagine Day.</p>
<p>I am passionate about accounting, data science, public speaking and making caricatures. Upon graduation, I am eager to pursue the Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA) Designation. Currently, I am honing my skills in R, MySQL and GitHub in Cape Town, South Africa. I intend to build my career in Accounting, Financial Technologies and Data Science.</p>
